<h1 align = "center" > SOUL-BOUND Tokens (SBTs) </h1>
Vitalik Buterin coauthored a paper outlining his vision for a  <b>“decentralized society” (DeSoc)</b>
where individuals accrue a permanent record of merits and attributes that are stored in private blockchain wallets as:-  <h3> Non-Tradable Crypto Assets.</h3>

“For example, a person might have a Soul that stores SBTs representing educational credentials, employment history, or hashes of their writings or works of art,” the paper says.

Unlike a non-fungible token (NFT), which is a collectible digital asset that can be traded or sold, SBTs are designed to be untradable—a little more like a college degree.
